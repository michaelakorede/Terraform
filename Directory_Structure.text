// Azure Networking Project using Terraform: 
Hub-Spoke Architecture Deployment

This project involves deploying a Hub-Spoke Network Architecture in Azure using Terraform. In this architecture, 
a Hub Virtual Network (VNet) will serve as the central network and will be connected to multiple Spoke VNets, 
with shared services like a VPN Gateway, Azure Firewall, and Bastion Host in the Hub network.

// Case Study: 
Company Network Segmentation Using Hub-Spoke Topology
Scenario: A large company, "TheAchievershub," has multiple departments, each requiring its own isolated network to run workloads securely. 
The IT department wants to centralize shared services like firewalls, VPN gateways, and security controls in one Hub network while ensuring each department 
(HR, Finance, and Engineering) has its own Spoke network for running applications. The network must be scalable for future expansion and easy to monitor and secure.

Objective: Deploy a Hub-Spoke architecture using Terraform with centralized services in the Hub VNet and multiple Spoke VNets for different departments. 
The Spokes will communicate with the Hub but not with each other. 

The architecture must include:

// Hub network with a Firewall and VPN Gateway.
// Spoke networks for HR, Finance, and Engineering departments.
// VNet Peering between the Hub and each Spoke.

Step-by-Step Guide: Terraform Hub-Spoke Deployment in Azure

1. Prerequisites
-Terraform installed on your machine.
-Azure CLI installed for authentication (az login).
-Azure Subscription where resources will be deployed.


Deployment Steps
Initialize Terraform: Run the following command in the project directory to initialize the configuration:

// terraform init
Plan the Infrastructure: Before applying, you can view what Terraform will create by running:

// terraform plan
Deploy the Infrastructure: Apply the configuration to deploy the Hub-Spoke architecture:

// terraform apply
Verify the Resources:
